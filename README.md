# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone of a given text. It involves analyzing a piece of text, such as a sentence, a paragraph, or an entire document, to understand whether it expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

The primary goal of sentiment analysis is to extract subjective information from text data and classify it into different sentiment categories. It can be applied to a wide range of applications, such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, market research, and brand reputation management.

There are several approaches to perform sentiment analysis:

Rule-based approach: This approach involves using predefined rules or dictionaries to assign sentiment scores to words or phrases in the text. The sentiment scores can be positive, negative, or neutral, and the overall sentiment of the text is determined by aggregating the scores of individual words.

Machine learning approach: This approach involves training a machine learning model on a labeled dataset, where each text sample is annotated with its corresponding sentiment. The model learns patterns and relationships between the text and the sentiment labels, allowing it to predict the sentiment of unseen text data.

Lexicon-based approach: This approach uses sentiment lexicons, which are dictionaries that contain words or phrases along with their associated sentiment scores. The sentiment of a text is calculated by summing the sentiment scores of the words or phrases present in the text.

Hybrid approach: This approach combines multiple techniques, such as rule-based and machine learning methods, to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of sentiment analysis. It leverages the strengths of different approaches to overcome their individual limitations.

Sentiment analysis can be performed at different levels of granularity, ranging from document-level sentiment analysis to aspect-based sentiment analysis, where the sentiment of specific aspects or entities within the text is analyzed.
